## Problem:

Our data got corrupted on the way here. 
Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! 
The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message.

## Encrypted File:

heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V091B0AE}2

## Solution:

Using the statement "Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around",
we can find key to be BCA and 3 block to be th distribution.
