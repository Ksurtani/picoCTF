## Problem:

There's an interesting script in the user's home directory
The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script 
which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag.
Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net
Port:     64055
Username: picoplayer
Password: password

## Solution:

Launch instance and you will find this on your screen.
Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net
Port:     64055
Username: picoplayer
Password: password

Go to terminal and connect to the portby typing:"ssh -p 64055 picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net"
NOTE:
a)The port is diffrent for everyone.
b)In terminal you won’t see the password getting typed.
c)-p is used when a specific port is used.

Type the password and you will be connected.
Try ls to see the list of all files.
You will find useless named file.
Try cd or cat on the file to check if it is a directory or readable file.
Once the file is read you will get this code:

#!/bin/bash
# Basic mathematical operations via command-line arguments

if [ $# != 3 ]
then
  echo "Read the code first"
else
	if [[ "$1" == "add" ]]
	then 
	  sum=$(( $2 + $3 ))
	  echo "The Sum is: $sum"  

	elif [[ "$1" == "sub" ]]
	then 
	  sub=$(( $2 - $3 ))
	  echo "The Substract is: $sub" 

	elif [[ "$1" == "div" ]]
	then 
	  div=$(( $2 / $3 ))
	  echo "The quotient is: $div" 

	elif [[ "$1" == "mul" ]]
	then
	  mul=$(( $2 * $3 ))
	  echo "The product is: $mul" 

	else
	  echo "Read the manual"
	 
	fi
fi

Reading the code you will find the else part doesn’t make sense and that’s the hint.
To read the manual in linux we use the 'man' command.
Try 'man useless' and this will be the output:

useless
     useless, — This is a simple calculator script

SYNOPSIS
     useless, [add sub mul div] number1 number2

DESCRIPTION
     Use the useless, macro to make simple calulations like addition,subtrac‐
     tion, multiplication and division.

Examples
     ./useless add 1 2
       This will add 1 and 2 and return 3

     ./useless mul 2 3
       This will return 6 as a product of 2 and 3

     ./useless div 6 3
       This will return 2 as a quotient of 6 and 3

     ./useless sub 6 5
       This will return 1 as a remainder of substraction of 5 from 6
