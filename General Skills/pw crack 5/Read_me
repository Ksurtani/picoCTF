## Problem:

Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll
need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same
directory too. Here's a dictionary with all possible
passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far.

## Solution:

Use the Python file uploaded in the folder and download all other files.
and keep them in the same directory.

## Flag:
picoCTF{h45h_sl1ng1ng_36e992a6}
